# CodeX Launcher
Simple launcher for the CodeX software by dexyfex.

![Simple UI of the CodeX launcher, contains 4 buttons, the upper most button is labeled as "CodeX", and has a description of "Lets you explore the map", the one below that is labeled "CodeX Explorer" and has a description of "Lets you explore game files"... I hope whoever checking this is happy, it was annoying to write.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935957107268812873/1030331149215596564/unknown.png)
